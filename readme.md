.dotfiles
=========
personal dotfiles... nothing more...

Install
=======
* run `sh deploy.sh`. NB: this will delete and replace a lot of files in your home directory.

Laptop versions
===============
Some of the configuration files have their own laptop version. This because the needs on a laptop might differ from my needs on a desktop computer. During installation (above), one will be prompted which version one wishes to use.

Disclaimer
==========
Most of these dotfiles are suited for a arch/i3 (i3wm.org) enviroment. Use at own risk.
